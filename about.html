                <p> Hi! Thanks for visiting our page. My name is Eve, and I’m the creator of Creating As We Grow. A bit about me:<br>I’m a mum of three 
                    with a background in data analysis. I’m also an aspiring software developer and tester, with a Level 4 BCS certification in 
                    full‑stack web development — and yes, I built this website myself.<br>
                    Now onto the brand:<br>
                    I started this account during lockdown while on maternity leave. With children’s clubs closed, I began creating simple 
                    activities at home to keep my little ones engaged. At the time they were between 0 and 2 years old, so the play naturally 
                    ranged from sensory exploration to early problem‑solving. I quickly realised how much I enjoyed designing these moments for 
                    them, and I wanted to keep nurturing that creativity as they grew, because learning never really stops. That’s where the name 
                    Creating As We Grow comes from — a reminder that creativity evolves alongside us. Sharing these experiences with my children and 
                    watching their curiosity unfold has been one of the most rewarding parts of this journey.
