                <p> Hi! Thanks for visiting our page. My name is Eve and I am the creator of Creating As We Grow. A bit about me: <br>
                    I'm a mom of 3 and my background is in data analysis. I'm an aspiring software
                    developer and tester, and have a level 4 BCS certification for full stack web development. In fact, I
                    built this web page. Now onto the brand: <br>
                    I started this account during lockdown. I was on maternity leave
                    and could not take my young kids to children's clubs, so I decided 
                    to create fun activities for them at home. The age range was 0 to 2 years old, so the range of play was varied.
                    I knew I would love this and wanted to continue creating for them as they grew older, because you never stop 
                    learning. This is why I called the account Creating As We Grow, because we don't stop 
                    creating, it just grows and develops with us. I loved sharing this time with them 
                    and watching how their brains solved problems.
