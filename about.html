                I'm a mom of 3 and my background is in data analysis. I'm an aspiring software
                developer and tester, and am a level 4 certified full stack developer. In fact, I
                built this web page by myself. Enough about me, and more about my brand - Creating As We Grow.
                I started this account during lockdown. I was on maternity leave
                and could not take my young kids to children's clubs, so I decided 
                to create fun activities for them. They were different ages at the time
                so the range of play was for 0+ years. I knew I would love this and wanted to continue as they grew
                because learning never stops. This is why I called the account Creating As We Grow, because we don't stop 
                creating, it just grows and develops with us. I loved sharing this time with them 
                and watching how their brains solve problems. I kept to this up for years even 
                once they started school.
